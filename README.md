# Interest Link 2

A tool to help people figure out what interests they have in common, without revealing what they don't have in common

# Quickstart:

Open in visual studio code and accept the prompt to use a devcontainer, or use github's online IDE:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/shish/link2)

Once the IDE is open, `npm run all` to start backend and frontend at once.

A built-in browser in the IDE should open automatically, with hot-reloading configured for both backend and frontend code.

There are a pre-generated set of user accounts, surveys, and responses. Log in as "alice" with password "alicepass", "bob" and "bobpass", etc

# Slowstart

## Build frontend:

```
npm install
npm run dev    # for debugging
npm run build  # for prod
```

## Backend:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install --group dev -e .
./.venv/bin/flask --app backend.app init-db    # create a database with example data
./.venv/bin/flask --app backend.app run --port 8000 --debug            # for debugging
./.venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 'backend.app:create_app()' -b 0.0.0.0:8000   # for prod
```

## Migrating from v1:

```
cp /websites/link1/data/link1.sqlite ./data/link1.sqlite
./migrate.sh
```
